                    <p>Cedar is Scott’s favorite type of wood. “It smells better than white fir, splits better than pine, and it has more personality than spruce,” said Scott London over 15 years ago during an interview with the Lewiston Tribune. Scott also loves to fish and camp with his wife Leanne London.</p>
